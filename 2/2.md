# Pong game 
player vs IA 
IA track the y position of the ball and follow it 
basicaly if IA speed is =>6 it's impossible to win 
you could edit it on the main function

```cpp
    IA.speed  = 4; // change it 
```

also editing on the screen size is valid 
```
to do list :
[] edit the size
[] make graphics better
